# Stock Exchange API

This project is for learning purposes only.

Itâ€™s a very simple API in order to access a database where is located data about stock prices, volumes of shares, etc.

With the API, it's possible to have some information:
- what's the closing price of a specific stock in a specific date;
- how many shares were traded for a specific stock in a specific date;
- the variation of a stock's price, given a period of time;
- etc.

For this project, I'm coding in Python, using Visual Studio Code. The data are stored in a PostgreSQL database. And, for the routes, I'm using Flask framework.
